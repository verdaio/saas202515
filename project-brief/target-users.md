## 👥 Primary User Persona: Commercial Cleaning Operations Manager

### Demographics
- **Age range:** 35-55
- **Job title/role:** Operations Manager, Owner/Operator, Account Manager
- **Industry:** Commercial janitorial services
- **Company size:** 10-100 cleaners, $500k-$5M annual revenue
- **Tech savviness:** Medium (uses Excel, QuickBooks, basic software)
- **Geographic:** Mid-sized cities (100k-2M population)

### Pain Points
1. **Contract risk from QA disputes** - "Client says it wasn't cleaned, we have no proof"
2. **Chargebacks eating into margins** - "We lose $500-2k/month to disputed work"
3. **Manual scheduling chaos** - "I spend 2 hours every morning dealing with no-shows"
4. **No crew accountability** - "I don't know who actually cleaned what site"
5. **Dispatcher burnout** - "Call-outs and rescheduling are killing my office manager"
6. **Client communication overhead** - "Clients constantly ask for status updates"

### Goals
1. **Protect contracts** - Never lose a contract over QA disputes
2. **Reduce chargebacks** - Cut disputed charges by 50%+
3. **Save time** - Get 2+ hours back from scheduling/admin
4. **Improve accountability** - Know exactly who did what, when
5. **Scale operations** - Add more sites without adding office staff
6. **Impress clients** - Offer real-time visibility they don't expect

### How They'll Use This Product

**Morning (6am-8am):**
- Check overnight shifts for exceptions/no-shows
- Review crew check-ins via geofencing
- Handle client inquiries with QA dashboard links

### Buying Process

2. **Research:** Google search, industry Facebook groups, peer recommendations
3. **Evaluation:** Demo must show proof-of-work and time savings

5. **Budget:** $200-500/month is acceptable for clear ROI
6. **Timeline:** Can implement within 1-2 weeks (urgent pain)

### Objections
- "My crews won't use technology" → Mobile-first, simple UX, language toggle
- "We tried software before and it didn't stick" → On-site setup, QR kits, hand-holding
- "Our clients don't care about QA" → Offer them the dashboard, they'll love it
- "Too expensive for our margins" → Show chargeback reduction and time savings ROI

## 💡 Key Insight

**The buying unit is the Operations Manager, but adoption depends on crew success.**

If crews hate the app, the Operations Manager will churn. Therefore:
- **Mobile UX must be dead simple** (< 5 taps to complete checklist)
- **Language support is mandatory** (Spanish toggle)
- **Geofencing must be accurate** (no false "late" alerts)
- **Photos must be easy** (built-in camera, not upload)

**Nail crew UX → retention follows.**
