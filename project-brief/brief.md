## 💡 The Problem

Commercial cleaning companies juggle overlapping schedules, handwritten notes, and fragmented client communication. Pain shows up in:
- **Missed shifts** and scheduling conflicts
- **Poor QA visibility** for clients
- **Manual rescheduling** eating up dispatcher time
- **Chargebacks** from unverified work

This chaos costs companies money, threatens contracts, and creates operational stress.

A **commercial janitorial management platform** focused on **QA + staffing control**:

**For Crews:**

- Site checklists with photos/video proof
- QR station scans for verification
- Language toggle for multilingual teams

**For Dispatchers:**
- Drag-drop shift board with conflict detection
- Automated exception alerts and supervisor escalations
- No-show escalation workflows
- Centralized site notes (keys/codes, special instructions)

**For Clients:**

## 👥 Target Users

**Primary:** Commercial janitorial companies
- 10-100 cleaners
- Multi-site contracts (offices, medical facilities, schools, retail)
- Currently using generic schedulers or paper/Excel
- Pain: Client chargebacks and contract risk

**Secondary:** Residential cleaning services (future expansion)
- 5-50 cleaners
- Daily rescheduling and routing challenges

## 🏆 What Makes This Different

### Entry Wedge: QA/Inspections Depth

While competitors offer broad feature sets, we go **deep on quality assurance and proof-of-work**:
- **Reduces chargebacks** and protects contracts
- **Sticky once deployed** - becomes part of client contracts
- **Clear ROI** for cleaning companies
- **Lower churn** than residential-focused tools

### Competitive Landscape
- **Residential SMB tools:** Jobber, Housecall Pro, ZenMaid, Launch27, Maidily
- **Commercial janitorial:** Swept, CleanTelligent, Aspire
- **Generic schedulers:** When I Work, Deputy

**Our advantage:** Depth in commercial QA workflow, not breadth across all service types.
