## 💭 Why This Matters

Commercial cleaning is a **$60B+ industry** with massive operational inefficiency. Cleaning companies lose contracts over QA disputes, waste hours on manual scheduling, and struggle with crew accountability.

**We're not just building software—we're protecting livelihoods.**

A single lost contract can put a small cleaning company out of business. By making QA visible and verifiable, we help these companies:
- Retain high-value contracts
- Grow with confidence
- Treat crews fairly
- Serve clients better

**That's impact worth building.**
