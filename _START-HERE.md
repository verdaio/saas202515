## 🎉 Your Project is Ready!

This project has been created with a complete planning and documentation structure. Everything you need to plan, build, and ship your SaaS is here.

---

## 🚀 Three Steps to Get Started

### 1. Get Oriented (2 minutes)

**What you have:**
- ✅ Complete folder structure for planning and documentation
- ✅ Templates ready to use
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ VS Code workspace configured
- ✅ Architecture: Multi-Tenant=true (subdomain)

**Where things are:**
- `product/` - PRDs, roadmaps, features
- `sprints/` - Sprint plans, user stories
- `technical/` - Tech specs, ADRs, API docs
- `business/` - OKRs, metrics, goals
- `meetings/` - Notes, interviews

### 2. (Optional) Add Your Initial Vision

**Have a project brief ready?**

Add files to the `project-brief/` directory:
- `project-brief/brief.md` - Main project vision
- `project-brief/vision.md` - Long-term vision
- `project-brief/target-users.md` - User personas
- Or any other `.md` files - Claude will read them all!

Or skip this - Claude will ask you questions.

### 3. Start Planning

Open Claude Code and say:

> **"Help me get started with this project"**

Claude will guide you through creating your roadmap, sprint plan, and initial documents.

**When you're ready to code:**

This project integrates with **Claude Code Templates** - 163 agents and 210 commands for technical implementation.

See `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md` for setup instructions.

## ☁️ Azure Deployment

**This project includes complete Azure deployment automation!**

### What's Included

✅ **GitHub Actions CI/CD** - Automatic deployment on every push
✅ **Docker Configuration** - Multi-stage builds for Python and Node.js
✅ **Infrastructure as Code** - Bicep templates for all Azure resources
✅ **Complete Documentation** - Step-by-step guides in `technical/infrastructure/`
✅ **Management Scripts** - One-command setup and deployment

### Azure Resources That Will Be Provisioned

When you run the setup, these resources are created:
- **Azure Container Registry** - Stores Docker images
- **PostgreSQL 16 Database** - Azure Database for PostgreSQL
- **Redis Cache** - Azure Cache for Redis
- **Container Apps** - Staging + Production environments
- **Key Vault** - Secure secrets storage
- **Blob Storage** - File and media storage

**Cost:** ~$62/month (staging) or ~$300/month (production)

### How to Deploy

#### If You Didn't Provision During Project Creation

Run this command to provision all Azure resources:

```bash
cd C:\devop\saas202515
bash scripts/setup-azure-resources.sh
```

This takes 10-15 minutes and only needs to be done once.

#### After Azure is Provisioned

1. **Add GitHub Secrets** (one-time setup)
   - The setup script outputs values to paste into GitHub
   - Location: https://github.com/ChrisStephens1971/saas202515/settings/secrets/actions

2. **Deploy Automatically**
   ```bash
   # Deploy to staging
   git push origin develop

   # Deploy to production
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

### Documentation

Complete guides are in `technical/infrastructure/`:
- **AZURE-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md** - Complete deployment walkthrough
- **CI-CD-SETUP.md** - GitHub Actions configuration
- **ENVIRONMENT-STRATEGY.md** - Dev/Staging/Production strategy
- **SECRETS-MANAGEMENT.md** - Azure Key Vault guide
- **DATABASE-MIGRATION.md** - Database migration guide
