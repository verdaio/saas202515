# OKRs - Q1 2025 (MVP Phase)

**Period:** January 1, 2025 - March 31, 2025
**Trade Name:** Cleaning & Janitorial
**Owner:** Product Team
**Status:** Planning
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-09

---

## Company Vision & Strategy

**Vision:** Build the industry-standard QA platform for commercial janitorial services, protecting cleaning companies from chargebacks and contract loss through verifiable proof-of-work.

**This Quarter's Focus:** **Ship MVP and prove product-market fit with 10 beta accounts**

This is the make-or-break quarter. Success = 10 paying beta accounts demonstrating 30% fewer exceptions and 2+ hours/day saved. Failure = no customers or customers churning immediately.

### Key Result 2.1: Sign 10 paying beta accounts by March 31

- **Target:** 10 commercial cleaning companies (10-50 cleaners each) paying at least $200/month
- **Current:** 0 accounts
- **Progress:** 0% 🟢
- **Owner:** Founder / Sales Lead
- **Confidence:** Medium (requires proactive outreach + partnerships)

**Account Criteria:**
- Commercial janitorial (not residential)
- 10-50 active cleaners
- 5+ multi-site contracts
- Currently using paper/Excel or generic schedulers
- Willing to provide weekly feedback

**Lead Sources:**
- Industry Facebook groups (Commercial Cleaning Professionals)
- Local supplier partnerships (janitorial supply distributors)
- Referrals from pilot accounts (Friends & Family)
- Targeted outreach (LinkedIn, cold email)

**Pricing:**
- Beta discount: $199/month (normally $149 base + $12/cleaner = $269 for 10 cleaners)
- Includes: Core platform + 2 client QA dashboard seats
- Contract: Month-to-month (no long-term commitment)

**Progress Updates:**
- 2025-11-09: Created target account list (20 prospects)
- [Week 2]: Outreach begins (10 conversations)
- [Week 6]: First 3 beta accounts signed
- [Week 10]: 7 beta accounts signed
- [Week 12]: 10+ beta accounts signed

### Key Result 2.2: Achieve 30% reduction in exceptions for beta accounts

- **Target:** 30% fewer exceptions (no-shows, client complaints, missed tasks) within 30 days of onboarding
- **Current:** Baseline to be measured at onboarding
- **Progress:** 0% 🟢
- **Owner:** Product Manager
- **Confidence:** Medium (assumes product works as designed)

**Measurement Method:**
1. Measure exception rate for 2 weeks BEFORE platform (manual tracking)
2. Onboard to platform
3. Measure exception rate for 4 weeks AFTER platform
4. Calculate % reduction

**Example:**
- Before: 20 exceptions / 100 shifts = 20% exception rate
- After: 14 exceptions / 100 shifts = 14% exception rate
- Reduction: 30% fewer exceptions ✅

**Target Accounts:** 5 beta accounts (representative sample)

**Progress Updates:**
- [Week 6]: Baseline measurements from first 3 accounts
- [Week 10]: 30-day post-deployment measurements (3 accounts)
- [Week 12]: Validated 30% reduction in 5 accounts

### Key Result 2.3: Dispatcher saves 2+ hours/day (validated via time tracking)

- **Target:** Dispatchers report saving 2+ hours/day on scheduling and admin tasks
- **Current:** Baseline to be measured at onboarding
- **Progress:** 0% 🟢
- **Owner:** Product Manager
- **Confidence:** High (this is the core value prop)

**Measurement Method:**
1. Time diary for 1 week BEFORE platform (how long spent on scheduling, rescheduling, client inquiries)
2. Time diary for 2 weeks AFTER platform (same activities)
3. Calculate time savings

**Expected Time Savings:**
- Manual scheduling: 1 hour/day → 10 min/day (saved: 50 min)
- Rescheduling no-shows: 30 min/day → 5 min/day (saved: 25 min)
- Client status inquiries: 45 min/day → 5 min/day (saved: 40 min)
- Timesheet approval: 30 min/day → 10 min/day (saved: 20 min)
- **Total: 2hr 15min saved/day**

**Target Accounts:** All 10 beta accounts (dispatcher time diary)

**Progress Updates:**
- [Week 6]: Baseline time diaries from 3 dispatchers
- [Week 10]: Post-deployment time diaries (5 dispatchers)
- [Week 12]: Validated 2+ hours saved across 10 accounts

- [Week 12]: Cost validation ($302/month for 50 tenants)

### Key Result 3.2: Onboard new tenant in < 30 minutes (automated + runbook)

- **Target:** New tenant onboarded from signup to first shift in < 30 minutes
- **Current:** Manual process (not defined)
- **Progress:** 0% 🟢
- **Owner:** Product Operations
- **Confidence:** High (automation + clear runbook)

**Onboarding Process:**
1. **Account creation (5 min):** Tenant fills signup form → Azure AD B2C tenant created → Subdomain configured
2. **Data import (10 min):** CSV template for sites, crews → One-click import
3. **QR code generation (5 min):** Print QR packs per site → Ship to customer
4. **Training (10 min):** Watch 3-minute videos (dispatcher, crew, client)
5. **First shift created (5 min):** Dispatcher creates first shift → Assign crew
6. **Total: 35 minutes** (target 30, we're close)

**Automation:**
